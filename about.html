            <ul id="people">
              <h3 id="people h3">Paul</h3>
                <p>Paul brings years of film making experience to the team. He's made music videos and has taken part in EVERY 48 Hour Film Festival held!</p>
              <h3>Sam</h3>
                <p>Sam is the camera guy, he knows everything there is to know about shooting video or stills. He also edits like a beast and somehow makes what we did look more beautiful than it should.</p>
              <h3>Becky</h3>
                <p>When not writing speeches for extremely important people, Becky can be found giving epic speeches at BYO nights or writing killer scripts for our next project. Becky and Sam have a corgi named Barnaby who's Instagram account is definitely worth a look!</p>
              <h3>Tom</h3>
                <p>Tom wastes his day as a copyright lawyer, fortunately as lawyer he writes a lot! He teams with Becky on our writing team and does everything else required on a shoot. He also makes sick as custom cut throat razors! So if you mess with us, Tom will not only sue you, he will cut you too.</p>
              <h3>Serenity</h3>
                <p>Serenity turned up to 48 Hours this year to be our make-up artist. We'd never met her before but she fit in like one of the family! Go see her to get yo' nails did to look banging for your hot as date. Did I mention she acts?</p>
              <h3>Red</h3>
                <p>Red is enthusiastic about basicaly everything. He helps things run smoothly on set, acts occaisionally and runs this website. He also knows a more about sperm whales than you do.
              <h3>Ed</h3>
                <p>Ed is the sound guy, for a sound guy he is really quiet. When everyone else is fooling a round and cracking wise between takes he carries on working! He makes documentaries in his spare time too and makes us sound ever so sweet and soulful.</p>
